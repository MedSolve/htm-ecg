# HTM ECG implementation in MatLab and nupic
Data is prepared in matlab for encoding and processeing in nupic

# Getting started
Initially the data is prepared by matlab as follows:

* Use create image to create BW image from the data source
* Use imageMap to map that image into a bitmap of the image

Hereafter the data should be given to the HTM in nupic
